    "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful and popular technique that applies specialized knowledge to large language models (LLMs). However, traditional RAG methods tend to have increasingly long prompts, sometimes exceeding **40k**, which can result in high financial and latency costs. Moreover, the decreased information density within the prompts can lead to performance degradation in LLMs, such as the \"lost in the middle\" issue."

Similar concerns prompted Gabon to suspend membership in January 1995; it rejoined in July 2016. Iraq has remained a member of OPEC since the organization's founding, but Iraqi production was not a part of OPEC quota agreements from 1998 to 2016, due to the country's daunting political difficulties.\\n\\nQuestion: how many countries are a part of opec\\nAnswer:\",\n",
