# LLMLingua Series Documentation

## Principles

1. **Prompt Sensitivity**: Different components of a prompt, like instructions and questions, vary in sensitivity to compression. Contexts or documents, for example, are less sensitive. It's advisable to separate these components in the prompt for demonstrations, instructions, and questions.
2. **Granular Division**: For multi-document QA and few-shot learning, divide demonstrations and contexts into independent granularities. This helps with budget control and document reordering.
3. **Essential Character Preservation**: Preserve essential characters as required by the scenario rules. **Support for this feature is now available in Structured Prompt Compression and LLMLingua-2**.
4. **Optimization through Experimentation**: Experiment with various target compression ratios and other hyperparameters to optimize performance.

## Basic Usage

With **LLMLingua**, you can easily compress your prompts. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

```python
from llmlingua import PromptCompressor

llm_lingua = PromptCompressor()
compressed_prompt = llm_lingua.compress_prompt(prompt, instruction="", question="", target_token=200)

# > {'compressed_prompt': 'Question: Sam bought a dozen boxes, each with 30 highlighter pens inside, for $10 each box. He reanged five of boxes into packages of sixlters each and sold them $3 per. He sold the rest theters separately at the of three pens $2. How much did make in total, dollars?\nLets think step step\nSam bought 1 boxes x00 oflters.\nHe bought 12 * 300ters in total\nSam then took 5 boxes 6ters0ters.\nHe sold these boxes for 5 *5\nAfterelling these  boxes there were 3030 highlighters remaining.\nThese form 330 / 3 = 110 groups of three pens.\nHe sold each of these groups for $2 each, so made 110 * 2 = $220 from them.\nIn total, then, he earned $220 + $15 = $235.\nSince his original cost was $120, he earned $235 - $120 = $115 in profit.\nThe answer is 115',
#  'origin_tokens': 2365,
#  'compressed_tokens': 211,
#  'ratio': '11.2x',
#  'saving': ', Saving $0.1 in GPT-4.'}

## Or use the phi-2 model,
llm_lingua = PromptCompressor("microsoft/phi-2")

## Or use the quantation model, like TheBloke/Llama-2-7b-Chat-GPTQ, only need <8GB GPU memory.
## Before that, you need to pip install optimum auto-gptq
llm_lingua = PromptCompressor("TheBloke/Llama-2-7b-Chat-GPTQ", model_config={"revision": "main"})
```

To try **LongLLMLingua** in your scenorias, you can use

```python
from llmlingua import PromptCompressor

llm_lingua = PromptCompressor()
compressed_prompt = llm_lingua.compress_prompt(
    prompt_list,
    question=question,
    ratio=0.55,
    # Set the special parameter for LongLLMLingua
    condition_in_question="after_condition",
    reorder_context="sort",
    dynamic_context_compression_ratio=0.3, # or 0.4
    condition_compare=True,
    context_budget="+100",
    rank_method="longllmlingua",
)
```

To try **LLMLingua-2** in your scenorias, you can use

```python
from llmlingua import PromptCompressor

llm_lingua = PromptCompressor(
    model_name="microsoft/llmlingua-2-xlm-roberta-large-meetingbank",
    use_llmlingua2=True,
)
compressed_prompt = llm_lingua.compress_prompt(prompt, rate=0.33, force_tokens = ['\n', '?'])

## Or use LLMLingua-2-small model
llm_lingua = PromptCompressor(
    model_name="microsoft/llmlingua-2-bert-base-multilingual-cased-meetingbank",
    use_llmlingua2=True,
)
```

## Advanced Usage

### Utilizing Small Models

### Using phi-2

Thanks to the efforts of the community, phi-2 is now available for use in LLMLingua.

Before using it, please update your transformers to the GitHub version by running `pip install -U git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git`.

```python
llm_lingua = PromptCompressor("microsoft/phi-2")
```

### Quantized Models

(Long)LLMLingua supports the use of quantized small models such as `TheBloke/Llama-2-7b-Chat-GPTQ`, which require less than 8GB of GPU memory.

To begin, ensure you install the necessary packages with:

```bash
pip install optimum auto-gptq
```

Then, initialize your model as follows:

```python
from llmlingua import PromptCompressor

llm_lingua = PromptCompressor("TheBloke/Llama-2-7b-Chat-GPTQ", model_config={"revision": "main"})
```

### Structured Prompt Compression

Split text into sections, decide on whether to compress and its rate. Use `<llmlingua></llmlingua>` tags for context segmentation, with optional `rate` and `compress` parameters.

```python
structured_prompt = """<llmlingua, compress=False>Speaker 4:</llmlingua><llmlingua, rate=0.4> Thank you. And can we do the functions for content? Items I believe are 11, three, 14, 16 and 28, I believe.</llmlingua><llmlingua, compress=False>
Speaker 0:</llmlingua><llmlingua, rate=0.4> Item 11 is a communication from Council on Price recommendation to increase appropriation in the general fund group in the City Manager Department by $200 to provide a contribution to the Friends of the Long Beach Public Library.

compressed_prompt = llm_lingua.structured_compress_prompt(structured_prompt, instruction="", question="", rate=0.5)
print(compressed_prompt['compressed_prompt'])

### Compress Json data

You can specify the compression method for each key and value by passing a config or a yaml config file. Each key must include four parameters: `rate` indicates the compression ratio for the corresponding value, `compress` indicates whether the corresponding value is compressed, `value_type` indicates the data type of the value, and `pair_remove` indicates whether the key-value pair can be completely deleted.

```python
json_data = {
    "id": 987654,

### Training Your Own LLMLingua-2

Not performing well on some domain-specific tasks? Don't worry, we've released code to help you build your own training data by instructing GPT-4 to compress your custom corpus and train compressors on the distilled data.

#### Data collection

First, format your data to a list of dict, with each dict containing at least two keys: _idx_ and _prompt_. [**format_data.py**](./experiments/llmlingua2/data_collection/format_data.py) illustrates how we format the meetingbank data.

Then, instruct GPT-4 to compress the original context.

```bash
cd experiments/llmlingua2/data_collection/
python compress.py --load_origin_from <your data path> \
--chunk_size 512 \
--compressor llmcomp \
--model_name gpt-4-32k \
--save_path <compressed data save path>

```

Then, assign label to the original words and filter out poor compression samples.

```bash
cd experiments/llmlingua2/data_collection/
python label_word.py \
--load_prompt_from <compressed data save path> \
--window_size 400 \
--save_path <labeled data save path> \

```

Filter out some poorly compressed / labeled samples.

```bash
cd experiments/llmlingua2/data_collection/
python filter.py --load_path <labeled data save path> \
--save_path <kept data save path>
```

#### Compressor Training

The [**model_training**](./experiments/llmlingua2/model_training) folder contains the code to train compressor on the distilled data.

```bash
cd cd experiments/llmlingua2/model_training/
python train_roberta.py --data_path <kept data save path>
```
