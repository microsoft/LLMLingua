# (Long)LLMLingua Documentation

## Principles

1. **Prompt Sensitivity**: Different components of a prompt, like instructions and questions, vary in sensitivity to compression. Contexts or documents, for example, are less sensitive. It's advisable to separate these components in the prompt for demonstrations, instructions, and questions.
2. **Granular Division**: For multi-document QA and few-shot learning, divide demonstrations and contexts into independent granularities. This helps with budget control and document reordering.
3. **Essential Character Preservation**: Preserve essential characters as required by the scenario rules. Support for this feature is forthcoming.
4. **Optimization through Experimentation**: Experiment with various target compression ratios and other hyperparameters to optimize performance.

## Initialization

## Advanced Usage

### Utilizing Small Models

### Using phi-2

Thanks to the efforts of the community, phi-2 is now available for use in LLMLingua. 

Before using it, please update your transformers to the GitHub version by running `pip install -U git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git`.

```python
llm_lingua = PromptCompressor("microsoft/phi-2")
```

### Quantized Models

(Long)LLMLingua supports the use of quantized small models such as `TheBloke/Llama-2-7b-Chat-GPTQ`, which require less than 8GB of GPU memory.

To begin, ensure you install the necessary packages with:

```bash
pip install optimum auto-gptq
```

Then, initialize your model as follows:

```python
from llmlingua import PromptCompressor

llm_lingua = PromptCompressor("TheBloke/Llama-2-7b-Chat-GPTQ", model_config={"revision": "main"})
```

### Integration with LlamaIndex

Thanks to the contributions of Jerry Liu (@jerryjliu), (Long)LLMLingua can be seamlessly integrated into LlamaIndex. Here's an example of how to initialize (Long)LLMLingua within LlamaIndex:

```python
from llama_index.query_engine import RetrieverQueryEngine
from llama_index.response_synthesizers import CompactAndRefine
from llama_index.indices.postprocessor import LongLLMLinguaPostprocessor

node_postprocessor = LongLLMLinguaPostprocessor(
    instruction_str="Given the context, please answer the final question",
    target_token=300,
    rank_method="longllmlingua",
    additional_compress_kwargs={
