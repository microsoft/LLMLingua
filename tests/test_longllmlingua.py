    GSM8K_PROMPT = "Question: Angelo and Melanie want to plan how many hours over the next week they should study together for their test next week. They have 2 chapters of their textbook to study and 4 worksheets to memorize. They figure out that they should dedicate 3 hours to each chapter of their textbook and 1.5 hours for each worksheet. If they plan to study no more than 4 hours each day, how many days should they plan to study total over the next week if they take a 10-minute break every hour, include 3 10-minute snack breaks each day, and 30 minutes for lunch each day?\nLet's think step by step\nAngelo and Melanie think they should dedicate 3 hours to each of the 2 chapters, 3 hours x 2 chapters = 6 hours total.\nFor the worksheets they plan to dedicate 1.5 hours for each worksheet, 1.5 hours x 4 worksheets = 6 hours total.\nAngelo and Melanie need to start with planning 12 hours to study, at 4 hours a day, 12 / 4 = 3 days.\nHowever, they need to include time for breaks and lunch. Every hour they want to include a 10-minute break, so 12 total hours x 10 minutes = 120 extra minutes for breaks.\nThey also want to include 3 10-minute snack breaks, 3 x 10 minutes = 30 minutes.\nAnd they want to include 30 minutes for lunch each day, so 120 minutes for breaks + 30 minutes for snack breaks + 30 minutes for lunch = 180 minutes, or 180 / 60 minutes per hour = 3 extra hours.\nSo Angelo and Melanie want to plan 12 hours to study + 3 hours of breaks = 15 hours total.\nThey want to study no more than 4 hours each day, 15 hours / 4 hours each day = 3.75\nThey will need to plan to study 4 days to allow for all the time they need.\nThe answer is 4\n\nQuestion: You can buy 4 apples or 1 watermelon for the same price. You bought 36 fruits evenly split between oranges, apples and watermelons, and the price of 1 orange is $0.50. How much does 1 apple cost if your total bill was $66?\nLet's think step by step\nIf 36 fruits were evenly split between 3 types of fruits, then I bought 36/3 = 12 units of each fruit\nIf 1 orange costs $0.50 then 12 oranges will cost $0.50 * 12 = $6\nIf my total bill was $66 and I spent $6 on oranges then I spent $66 - $6 = $60 on the other 2 fruit types.\nAssuming the price of watermelon is W, and knowing that you can buy 4 apples for the same price and that the price of one apple is A, then 1W=4A\nIf we know we bought 12 watermelons and 12 apples for $60, then we know that $60 = 12W + 12A\nKnowing that 1W=4A, then we can convert the above to $60 = 12(4A) + 12A\n$60 = 48A + 12A\n$60 = 60A\nThen we know the price of one apple (A) is $60/60= $1\nThe answer is 1\n\nQuestion: Susy goes to a large school with 800 students, while Sarah goes to a smaller school with only 300 students.  At the start of the school year, Susy had 100 social media followers.  She gained 40 new followers in the first week of the school year, half that in the second week, and half of that in the third week.  Sarah only had 50 social media followers at the start of the year, but she gained 90 new followers the first week, a third of that in the second week, and a third of that in the third week.  After three weeks, how many social media followers did the girl with the most total followers have?\nLet's think step by step\nAfter one week, Susy has 100+40 = 140 followers.\nIn the second week, Susy gains 40/2 = 20 new followers.\nIn the third week, Susy gains 20/2 = 10 new followers.\nIn total, Susy finishes the three weeks with 140+20+10 = 170 total followers.\nAfter one week, Sarah has 50+90 = 140 followers.\nAfter the second week, Sarah gains 90/3 = 30 followers.\nAfter the third week, Sarah gains 30/3 = 10 followers.\nSo, Sarah finishes the three weeks with 140+30+10 = 180 total followers.\nThus, Sarah is the girl with the most total followers with a total of 180.\nThe answer is 180"
