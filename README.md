## TL;DR

LLMLingua utilizes a compact, well-trained language model (e.g., GPT2-small, LLaMA-7B) to identify and remove non-essential tokens in prompts. This approach enables efficient inference with large language models (LLMs), achieving up to 20x compression with minimal performance loss.

  _Huiqiang Jiang, Qianhui Wu, Chin-Yew Lin, Yuqing Yang and Lili Qiu_

LongLLMLingua mitigates the 'lost in the middle' issue in LLMs, enhancing long-context information processing. It reduces costs and boosts efficiency with prompt compression, improving RAG performance by up to 21.4% using only 1/4 of the tokens.

  _Huiqiang Jiang, Qianhui Wu, Xufang Luo, Dongsheng Li, Chin-Yew Lin, Yuqing Yang and Lili Qiu_

LLMLingua-2, a small-size yet powerful prompt compression method trained via data distillation from GPT-4 for token classification with a BERT-level encoder, excels in task-agnostic compression. It surpasses LLMLingua in handling out-of-domain data, offering 3x-6x faster performance.

## üé• Overview

![Background](./images/LLMLingua_motivation.png)

- Ever encountered the token limit when asking ChatGPT to summarize lengthy texts?
- Frustrated with ChatGPT forgetting previous instructions after extensive fine-tuning?
- Experienced high costs using GPT3.5/4 API for experiments despite excellent results?

While Large Language Models like ChatGPT and GPT-4 excel in generalization and reasoning, they often face challenges like prompt length limits and prompt-based pricing schemes.

![Motivation for LLMLingua](./images/motivation.png)

Now you can use **LLMLingua**, **LongLLMLingua**, and **LLMLingua-2**!

These tools offer an efficient solution to compress prompts by up to **20x**, enhancing the utility of LLMs.

- üí∞ **Cost Savings**: Reduces both prompt and generation lengths with minimal overhead.
- üìù **Extended Context Support**: Enhances support for longer contexts, mitigates the "lost in the middle" issue, and boosts overall performance.
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Robustness**: No additional training needed for LLMs.
- üïµÔ∏è **Knowledge Retention**: Maintains original prompt information like ICL and reasoning.
- üìú **KV-Cache Compression**: Accelerates inference process.
- ü™É **Comprehensive Recovery**: GPT-4 can recover all key information from compressed prompts.

## üéØ Quick Start

#### 1. **Installing LLMLingua:**

To get started with LLMLingua, simply install it using pip:

```bash
pip install llmlingua
```

#### 2. **Using LLMLingua Series Methods for Prompt Compression:**

With **LLMLingua**, you can easily compress your prompts. Here‚Äôs how you can do it:

```python
from llmlingua import PromptCompressor

llm_lingua = PromptCompressor()
compressed_prompt = llm_lingua.compress_prompt(prompt, instruction="", question="", target_token=200)

# > {'compressed_prompt': 'Question: Sam bought a dozen boxes, each with 30 highlighter pens inside, for $10 each box. He reanged five of boxes into packages of sixlters each and sold them $3 per. He sold the rest theters separately at the of three pens $2. How much did make in total, dollars?\nLets think step step\nSam bought 1 boxes x00 oflters.\nHe bought 12 * 300ters in total\nSam then took 5 boxes 6ters0ters.\nHe sold these boxes for 5 *5\nAfterelling these  boxes there were 3030 highlighters remaining.\nThese form 330 / 3 = 110 groups of three pens.\nHe sold each of these groups for $2 each, so made 110 * 2 = $220 from them.\nIn total, then, he earned $220 + $15 = $235.\nSince his original cost was $120, he earned $235 - $120 = $115 in profit.\nThe answer is 115',
#  'origin_tokens': 2365,
#  'compressed_tokens': 211,
#  'ratio': '11.2x',
#  'saving': ', Saving $0.1 in GPT-4.'}

## Or use the phi-2 model,
llm_lingua = PromptCompressor("microsoft/phi-2")

## Or use the quantation model, like TheBloke/Llama-2-7b-Chat-GPTQ, only need <8GB GPU memory.
## Before that, you need to pip install optimum auto-gptq
llm_lingua = PromptCompressor("TheBloke/Llama-2-7b-Chat-GPTQ", model_config={"revision": "main"})
```

To try **LongLLMLingua** in your scenorias, you can use

```python
from llmlingua import PromptCompressor

llm_lingua = PromptCompressor()
compressed_prompt = llm_lingua.compress_prompt(
    prompt_list,
    question=question,
    ratio=0.55,
    # Set the special parameter for LongLLMLingua
    condition_in_question="after_condition",
    reorder_context="sort",
    dynamic_context_compression_ratio=0.3, # or 0.4
    condition_compare=True,
    context_budget="+100",
    rank_method="longllmlingua",
)
```

To try **LLMLingua-2** in your scenorias, you can use

```python
from llmlingua import PromptCompressor

llm_lingua = PromptCompressor(
    model_name="microsoft/llmlingua-2-xlm-roberta-large-meetingbank",
    use_llmlingua2=True, # Whether to use llmlingua-2
)
compressed_prompt = llm_lingua.compress_prompt(prompt, rate=0.33, force_tokens = ['\n', '?'])

## Or use LLMLingua-2-small model
llm_lingua = PromptCompressor(
    model_name="microsoft/llmlingua-2-bert-base-multilingual-cased-meetingbank",
    use_llmlingua2=True, # Whether to use llmlingua-2
)
```

#### 3. **Advanced usage - Structured Prompt Compression:**

Split text into sections, decide on whether to compress and its rate. Use `<llmlingua></llmlingua>` tags for context segmentation, with optional rate and compress parameters.

```python
structured_prompt = """<llmlingua, compress=False>Speaker 4:</llmlingua><llmlingua, rate=0.4> Thank you. And can we do the functions for content? Items I believe are 11, three, 14, 16 and 28, I believe.</llmlingua><llmlingua, compress=False>
Speaker 0:</llmlingua><llmlingua, rate=0.4> Item 11 is a communication from Council on Price recommendation to increase appropriation in the general fund group in the City Manager Department by $200 to provide a contribution to the Friends of the Long Beach Public Library. Item 12 is communication from Councilman Super Now. Recommendation to increase appropriation in the special advertising and promotion fund group and the city manager's department by $10,000 to provide support for the end of summer celebration. Item 13 is a communication from Councilman Austin. Recommendation to increase appropriation in the general fund group in the city manager department by $500 to provide a donation to the Jazz Angels . Item 14 is a communication from Councilman Austin.

Item 16 is a communication from Councilman Allen recommendation to increase appropriation in the general fund group in the city manager department by $1,020 to provide contribution to Casa Korero, Sew Feria Business Association, Friends of Long Beach Public Library and Dave Van Patten. Item 28 is a communication. Communication from Vice Mayor Richardson and Council Member Muranga. Recommendation to increase appropriation in the general fund group in the City Manager Department by $1,000 to provide a donation to Ron Palmer Summit. Basketball and Academic Camp.</llmlingua><llmlingua, compress=False>
Speaker 4:</llmlingua><llmlingua, rate=0.6> We have a promotion and a second time as councilman served Councilman Ringa and customers and they have any comments.</llmlingua>"""
compressed_prompt = llm_lingua.structured_compress_prompt(structured_prompt, instruction="", question="", rate=0.5)
print(compressed_prompt['compressed_prompt'])

# > Speaker 4:. And can we do the functions for content? Items I believe are11,,116 28,.
