## TL;DR

LLMLingua utilizes a compact, well-trained language model (e.g., GPT2-small, LLaMA-7B) to identify and remove non-essential tokens in prompts. This approach enables efficient inference with large language models (LLMs), achieving up to 20x compression with minimal performance loss.

LongLLMLingua mitigates the 'lost in the middle' issue in LLMs, enhancing long-context information processing. It reduces costs and boosts efficiency with prompt compression, improving RAG performance by up to 21.4% using only 1/4 of the tokens.

## üé• Overview

![Background](./images/LLMLingua_motivation.png)

- Ever encountered the token limit when asking ChatGPT to summarize lengthy texts?
- Frustrated with ChatGPT forgetting previous instructions after extensive fine-tuning?
- Experienced high costs using GPT3.5/4 API for experiments despite excellent results?

While Large Language Models like ChatGPT and GPT-4 excel in generalization and reasoning, they often face challenges like prompt length limits and prompt-based pricing schemes.

![Motivation for LLMLingua](./images/motivation.png)

Now you can use **LLMLingua** & **LongLLMLingua**!

These tools offer an efficient solution to compress prompts by up to **20x**, enhancing the utility of LLMs.

- üí∞ **Cost Savings**: Reduces both prompt and generation lengths.
- üìù **Extended Context Support**: Enhances support for longer contexts, mitigates the "lost in the middle" issue, and boosts overall performance.
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Robustness**: No additional training needed for LLMs.
- üïµÔ∏è **Knowledge Retention**: Maintains original prompt information like ICL and reasoning.
- üìú **KV-Cache Compression**: Accelerates inference process.
- ü™É **Comprehensive Recovery**: GPT-4 can recover all key information from compressed prompts.

## üéØ Quick Start

#### 1. **Installing (Long)LLMLingua:**

To get started with (Long)LLMLingua, simply install it using pip:

```bash
pip install llmlingua
```
    
#### 2. **Using (Long)LLMLingua for Prompt Compression:**

With (Long)LLMLingua, you can easily compress your prompts. Here‚Äôs how you can do it:

```python
from llmlingua import PromptCompressor

llm_lingua = PromptCompressor()
compressed_prompt = llm_lingua.compress_prompt(prompt, instruction="", question="", target_token=200)

# > {'compressed_prompt': 'Question: Sam bought a dozen boxes, each with 30 highlighter pens inside, for $10 each box. He reanged five of boxes into packages of sixlters each and sold them $3 per. He sold the rest theters separately at the of three pens $2. How much did make in total, dollars?\nLets think step step\nSam bought 1 boxes x00 oflters.\nHe bought 12 * 300ters in total\nSam then took 5 boxes 6ters0ters.\nHe sold these boxes for 5 *5\nAfterelling these  boxes there were 3030 highlighters remaining.\nThese form 330 / 3 = 110 groups of three pens.\nHe sold each of these groups for $2 each, so made 110 * 2 = $220 from them.\nIn total, then, he earned $220 + $15 = $235.\nSince his original cost was $120, he earned $235 - $120 = $115 in profit.\nThe answer is 115',
#  'origin_tokens': 2365,
#  'compressed_tokens': 211,
#  'ratio': '11.2x',
#  'saving': ', Saving $0.1 in GPT-4.'}

## Or use the phi-2 model,
## Before that, you need to update the transformers to the github version, like pip install -U git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git
llm_lingua = PromptCompressor("microsoft/phi-2")

## Or use the quantation model, like TheBloke/Llama-2-7b-Chat-GPTQ, only need <8GB GPU memory.
## Before that, you need to pip install optimum auto-gptq
llm_lingua = PromptCompressor("TheBloke/Llama-2-7b-Chat-GPTQ", model_config={"revision": "main"})
```

#### 3. **Learning More:**

To understand how to apply LLMLingua and LongLLMLingua in real-world scenarios like RAG, Online Meetings, CoT, and Code, please refer to our [**examples**](./examples). For detailed guidance, the [**documentation**](./DOCUMENT.md) provides extensive recommendations on effectively utilizing LLMLingua.
