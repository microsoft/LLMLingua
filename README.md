## News

- 🎈 We launched a [project page](https://llmlingua.com/) showcasing real-world case studies, including RAG, Online Meetings, CoT, and Code;
- 👾 LongLLMLingua has been incorporated into the [LlamaIndex pipeline](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/blob/main/llama_index/indices/postprocessor/longllmlingua.py), which is a widely used RAG framework.

## Tl;DR

LLMLingua, that uses a well-trained small language model after alignment, such as GPT2-small or LLaMA-7B, to detect the unimportant tokens in the prompt and enable inference with the compressed prompt in black-box LLMs, achieving up to 20x compression with minimal performance loss.

LongLLMLingua is a method that enhances LLMs' ability to perceive key information in long-context scenarios using prompt compression, achieveing up to $28.5 in cost savings per 1,000 samples while also improving performance.

## 🎥 Overview

![image](./images/LLMLingua_motivation.png)

- Have you ever tried to input a long text and ask ChatGPT to summarize it, only to be told that it exceeds the token limit? ​
- Have you ever spent a lot of time fine-tuning the personality of ChatGPT, only to find that it forgets the previous instructions after a few rounds of dialogue? ​
- Have you ever used the GPT3.5/4 API for experiments, and got good results, but also received a huge bill after a few days? ​

Large language models, such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, impress us with their amazing generalization and reasoning abilities, but they also come with some drawbacks, such as the prompt length limit and the prompt-based pricing scheme.​

Now you can use **LLMLingua** & **LongLLMLingua**!​

A simple and efficient method to compress prompt up to **20x**.​

- 💰 **Saving cost**, not only prompt, but also the generation length;​
- 📝 **Support longer contexts**, enhance the density of key information in the prompt and mitigate loss in the middle, thereby improving overall performance.
- ⚖️ **Robustness**, no need any training for the LLMs;​
- 🕵️ **Keeping** the original prompt knowledge like ICL, reasoning, etc.​
- 📜 **KV-Cache compression**, speedup inference;​

## 🎯 Quick Start

Install LLMLingua,

```bash
pip install llmlingua
```
    
Then, you can use LLMLingua to compress your prompt,
    
```python
from llmlingua import PromptCompressor

llm_lingua = PromptCompressor()
compressed_prompt = llm_lingua.compress_prompt(prompt, instruction="", question="", target_token=200)

# > {'compressed_prompt': 'Question: Sam bought a dozen boxes, each with 30 highlighter pens inside, for $10 each box. He reanged five of boxes into packages of sixlters each and sold them $3 per. He sold the rest theters separately at the of three pens $2. How much did make in total, dollars?\nLets think step step\nSam bought 1 boxes x00 oflters.\nHe bought 12 * 300ters in total\nSam then took 5 boxes 6ters0ters.\nHe sold these boxes for 5 *5\nAfterelling these  boxes there were 3030 highlighters remaining.\nThese form 330 / 3 = 110 groups of three pens.\nHe sold each of these groups for $2 each, so made 110 * 2 = $220 from them.\nIn total, then, he earned $220 + $15 = $235.\nSince his original cost was $120, he earned $235 - $120 = $115 in profit.\nThe answer is 115',

#  'ratio': '11.2x',
